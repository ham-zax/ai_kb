Here is a summary of our session so far:
1. Our Main Goal:
To understand and use the core A1 Modal Verbs (Modalverben). These are verbs that change the meaning of another verb.
2. The Verbs We've Learned:
We focused on the four most common ones, discovering their "feeling" or context:
möchte - for polite wishes ("would like to")
müssen - for necessity ("must", "have to")
können - for ability ("can")
wollen - for strong intention ("want to")
3. The Most Important Discovery (The "Aha!" Moment):
You correctly noticed that German sentence structure with these verbs is different from English. We established the key rule: The "Satzklammer" (Sentence Bracket).
The modal verb is conjugated and placed in the second position.
The main action verb goes to the very end of the sentence in its original infinitive form.
4. Sentences We Analyzed and Built:
Ich möchte einen Kaffee trinken und mein Buch lesen.
Wir müssen Essen kaufen.
Kannst du bitte mitkommen?
Ich will nicht alleine gehen.
Du kannst gut singen.
Wir müssen jetzt gehen.
Sie will ein Buch kaufen.
In short, you have successfully learned the meaning of four crucial verbs and mastered the fundamental sentence structure for using them.
The very next step, which we were just about to take, is to practice how they change for different people (ich kann, du kannst, er kann, etc.).
